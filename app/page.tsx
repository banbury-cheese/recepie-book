        <b> Recipes for Food </b>is a platform for sharing recipes that I have
        collected from my friends, peers, strangers, internet, cooking classes
        etc. They range from actual recipes, to more ingredients for a nap. I
        make no guarantees over the outcome of each recipe, so enjoy at your own
        risk : ).
